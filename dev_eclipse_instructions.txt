======================================

To get FactionsPlus from github into your Eclipse workspace:
------
File->Import,  Git->Projects From Git, Next, URI, Next
fill in URI: with one of the following:
git://github.com/MarkehMe/FactionsPlus.git
https://github.com/MarkehMe/FactionsPlus.git
(for read-only access!)
Next, Next
Choose a location in your eclipse workspace under a folder named "FactionsPlus"
ie. Directory: C:\eclipse.workspace\FactionsPlus
or wherever else you want to store the git part

Finish
======================================

In order to be able to compile this without errors in Eclipse, here's what you need:

------
A. jars needed (put them in the "lib" folder in the FactionsPlus project)

1. bukkit.jar
    get one from here:
    http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/bukkit/
    
    the jar name may vary so you might have to:
    left click FactionsPlus project then right click, choose Properties, left click
    Java Build Path  then Libraries tab, click the "bukkit..." in list and Edit and choose the
    downloaded file, click Open, then Ok

2. DisguiseCraft.jar
   get the top one from here:
   http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/disguisecraft/files/
   v2.5 tested
   
3. MobDisguise.jar
    get top one from here:
    http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/mobdisguise/files/
    MobDisguise 1.81 tested
    
4. Vault.jar
    get top one from here:
    http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/vault/files/
    Vault 1.2.16 tested
    
5. WorldGuard.jar
    get second one (the .zip )from here (and extract the jar from it):
    http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldguard/files/
    WorldGuard 5.5.2 tested
    
6. WorldEdit.jar
    get the top .zip from here(and extract the jar from it):
    http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldedit/files/
    WorldEdit 5.3 tested

7. LWC.jar
   get the top one from here:
   http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/lwc/files/
   LWC 4.2.0 tested
   
8. Factions 1.7
   Rename the file from factions -> Factions 1.7
   http://dev.bukkit.org/media/files/593/841/Factions_1.7.5_beta.zip
   
9. Factions 1.6
   Rename the file from factions -> Factions 1.6
   http://dev.bukkit.org/media/files/593/842/Factions.jar
   
------   
B. Projects needed:

1. Factions, the 1.6.x branch
   from: https://github.com/MassiveCraft/Factions
   
If you have all these, the FactionsPlus project should compile without errors.
======================================


To actually export the .jar file  which would be named FactionsPlus.jar
------
Legend:
[ ] means deselected
[v] means selected
(*) radio button selected

left click the FactionsPlus project 
then right click on it or Alt+F  to open File menu
choose Export, Java->Jar file, Next, 
Expand FactionPlus, 
make sure only "src" folder is selected
click FactionsPlus
make sure only the following files are selected:
config_defaults.yml
plugin.yml

now go below and ensure the options look like so:
[v] Export generated class files and resources
[ ] Export all output folders for checked projects
[v] (Optional)Export Java source files and resources(if you want to include sourcecode *.java files)
[ ] Export refactorings for checked projects.

Jar file: x:\XXX\FactionsPlus.jar
    where x:\XXX\ is your location like c:\dumps\

Options:
[v] Compress the contents of the JAR file
[v] Add directory entries
[v] Overwrite existing files without warning (Optional, up to you: it will not ask you if destination .jar exists already)

Next,
[ ] Export class files with compile errors
[v] Export class files with compile warnings

Next,
(*) Generate the manifest file
[ ] Save the manifest in the workspace

(*) Seal the JAR  (irrelevant)

leave empty at Main class:
Finish

Caveats:
---
Note: If you're getting these errors in bukkit:

[SEVERE] Could not load 'plugins\FactionsPlus.jar' in folder 'plugins'
org.bukkit.plugin.InvalidPluginException: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError
: markehme/factionsplus/FactionsPlus : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0

Caused by: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: markehme/factionsplus/Faction
sPlus : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0

It just means, that your server is running in jvm with a lower version that the compiled FactionsPlus.jar  
ie. your server running on jre6 and your jar was compiled with jre7 (well compiler compliance level 1.7 to be more exact)

Fix:
1. either run the server in jre7
2. or recompile FactionsPlus.jar with jre6 (which automatically means it'll use 1.6 ccl)

(we should have the project set to ccl 1.6 at the time of this writing, so you shouldn't have to worry about this)
